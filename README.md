# Project Title

My project will be to create a mario style game packaged in a Google Chrome Extension

## Description

I will create a Chrome Extension that packages a mario like game. The game will have two main goals. The first goal is to complete all of the levels in the fastest time. This is recorded through a game clock that is displayed. The second main goal of the game is to get the highest score possible. Throghout the game differnt "Coins" can be gathered by the user colliding with that "Coin". Users will be able record their scores by logging in.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

You must install the chrome extension from google store

No dependencies for those who download the extension.

It will be packaged so that the user has no dependenices, they just install it. 

### Installing
You will find it on the google play store and follow the simply download procedure that is already on the play store. Google already has a plethora of help resources for people who need it when downloading.
### Executing program

The program will run when you click the icon in the top right of the screen
One you click on the program you will be prompted to click any button on your comptuer to begin the game.

THe game utilizes the keys W,A,S,D to ove the charecter and spacebar to jump.

## Help
