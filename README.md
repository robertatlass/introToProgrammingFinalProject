# Project Title

My project with rate the sustainability of a product

## Description

I will create a Chrome Extension that compiles data to create an overall sustainability rating. The goal is to simplify knowledge of sustainability and promote sustainable shopping. My chrome extension will utilize a crawler algorithm to crawl wesbites, searching for the names of specific sustainbility certifications. Certifications such as B.Corp, Fair Trade, and Leaping Bunny, all have their own specific icons. I plan to crawl websites searching for their icons. When a user views a product with an icon the chrome extension detects it will deploy from chrome and display 5 bars and the more bars the better the product is in terms of sustainability. Behind the scenes the algortihm weights the different ratings, some are more robust than others.


## Getting Started

You must install the chrome extension from google store

No dependencies for those who download the extension.
It will be packaged so that the user has no dependenices, they just install it. 

### Installing

### Executing program
